# ROS Vietnam – Fleet Management & Distributed Robotics Systems  
`rosvn-fleet-management`

> **A production-grade, research-informed repository for fleet management, distributed robotics systems, and large-scale robot orchestration using ROS 2.**

---

## 1. Overview

**ROS Vietnam Fleet Management & Distributed Robotics Systems** is the official repository dedicated to **multi-robot orchestration at scale** within the ROS Vietnam ecosystem.

This repository focuses on:
- Fleet-level coordination
- Distributed system architecture
- Task allocation & scheduling
- System reliability and scalability

It bridges **academic multi-agent research** and **real-world industrial robotics systems**.

## 2. Why Fleet Management Matters

Single-robot autonomy does not scale to:
- Warehouses
- Campuses
- Cities
- Ports
- Factories

Fleet management introduces challenges beyond algorithms:
- Distributed communication
- Fault tolerance
- Latency & consistency
- System observability

> *Autonomy at scale is a systems problem.*

## 3. Philosophy

### 3.1 Distributed by Design
- No single point of failure
- Explicit communication models
- Graceful degradation

### 3.2 ROS 2 Native
- DDS-based communication
- QoS-aware design
- Lifecycle-managed nodes

### 3.3 Separation of Concerns
- Robot autonomy ≠ fleet orchestration
- Clear API boundaries
- Replaceable components

### 3.4 Production Readiness
- Observability
- Versioning
- Security awareness
